# "You've got to jump off the cliff and build your wings on the way down" - Ray Bradbury

I'm learning Vulkan, Graphics programming, low level computing, optimization, computer rendering methods. I want to make a realtime sci-fi game with ReSTIR, among other special features. This might not work out, but I don't really care right now. Currently, it can only (poorly) render fractals.
