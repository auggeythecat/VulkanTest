# "You've got to jump off the cliff and build your wings on the way down" - Ray Bradbury

I'm learning Vulkan, Graphics programming, low level computing, general optimization, computer rendering methods, debugging, and graphics debugging. I want to make a real-time sci-fi game with ReSTIR, among other special features. This might not work out, but I don't really care right now. Currently, it can only (poorly) render (some) fractals.
